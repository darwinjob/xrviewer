## How can I play with it?
You need a VR headset and a modern browser. The current version is successfully tested with Steam, Firefox and the first generation HTC Vive (including the controllers). You will have to adjust Firefox setting like this:

## Is this fun/useful?
Not that much at the moment. This is mainly a proof of concept - like Atlas3D was for the anchoring procedures at its time https://www.frontiersin.org/10.3389/conf.neuro.11.2008.01.052/event_abstract But you surely can grab and move brain structures using the controllers :)
## What's next?
Adding all the structures, optimization (switching to another data format)
